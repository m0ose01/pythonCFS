# Python CFS

The Cambridge Electronic Design File System (CFS) is the file format used by the Signal Software Suite to record electrophysiological data, such as data from Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation experiments.

This is a Python interface to my [other project](https://github.com/m0ose01/CFS), which reimplements some of the public API of CED's own C library to read CFS files.
